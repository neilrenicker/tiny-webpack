# tiny-webpack

This is the simplest possible [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) configuration that still has
hot-reloading and CSS.

It's basically just the
[webpack Getting Started article](http://webpack.github.io/docs/tutorials/getting-started/).

## Setup:

```sh
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:8080/
```
